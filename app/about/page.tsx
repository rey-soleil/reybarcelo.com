          I attended <b>Stanford University</b> from 2015-2019, where I studied
          computer science with a concentration in artificial intelligence.
          Along the way, I took classes at the school of design, studied film
          and philosophy at Oxford, and did several internships at Google.
        </p>
        <p>
          After graduating, I joined <b>Google</b> full time as a software
          engineer. There, I worked on the Google Assistant to train neural
          networks to understand natural language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, I&apos;ve worked as a product engineer at several
          early-stage <b>startups</b>, where I learned to think more broadly
          about product and design. I&apos;ve built features like user profiles,
          analytics dashboards, and web scrapers, just to name a few.
        </p>

          I see myself as a tech generalist: someone equally comfortable
          building React apps, prototyping in Figma, or even talking directly to
          customers to understand their needs.
        </p>

          When I&apos;m not coding, I&apos;m also an avid reader üìö, meditator
          ‚òØ, and rock climber üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
